Hello! This is my editor: "vedditor" written in Rust!!! 

I'm still working on it's features but it has been great so far! 

For now we have the following features:

- Save/Save as 
- Filetype and document size details
- Search inside the document and navigate through results
- Syntax Highlighting (WIP)

How to run:

```sh
cargo run <file-name> 
```
